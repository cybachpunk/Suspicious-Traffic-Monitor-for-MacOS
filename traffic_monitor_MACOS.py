# Suspicious Traffic Alerter for macOS
#
# This script monitors your network traffic for suspicious activity and
# sends a native macOS notification if it finds anything.
#
# Author: Gemini
# Version: 1.0.0
#
# --- DESCRIPTION ---
# This script performs two main checks:
# 1.  It downloads a list of known malicious IP addresses from a public
#     blocklist (abuse.ch Feodo Tracker) and checks if any incoming or
#     outgoing traffic is communicating with these IPs.
# 2.  It monitors for potential port scanning activity by tracking the number
#     of connection attempts from a single source to multiple ports on your
#     machine.
#
# When suspicious activity is detected, a native macOS notification is
# displayed with details about the event.
#
# --- REQUIREMENTS ---
# This script requires Python 3 and the following third-party libraries:
# - scapy: For sniffing and analyzing network packets.
# - macos-notifications: For sending native macOS notifications.
# - requests: For downloading the IP blocklist.
#
# You can install these with pip:
# pip3 install scapy macos-notifications requests
#
# --- USAGE ---
# This script must be run with root privileges to capture network traffic.
#
# 1.  Save the script as a Python file (e.g., `traffic_alerter.py`).
# 2.  Make it executable: `chmod +x traffic_alerter.py`
# 3.  Run it with sudo: `sudo ./traffic_alerter.py`
#
# To stop the script, press Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running.
